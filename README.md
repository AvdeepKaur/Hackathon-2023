# Hackathon-2023
A major difficulty new students face is connecting with others. Whether that be finding friends, study buddies, or even just someone to talk to, it can be hard to find people with similar interests. Our website aims to solve this problem by providing a platform for students to connect with each other. Solely for BU sudents, this forum is a place where students can ask questions, share their experiences, offer advice, discuss their classes, and simply have the opportuntiy to conveniently connect.
